= Notes on design principles in the ows package =

== Leightweight classes ==

Some classes are slight extensions of types provided by python, such
as ows.is19115_subset.LanguageString that has a lang attribute but is
otherwise just a string.

In these cases a new-style class is provided with a {{{__slots__}}}
attribute to restrict it's size.  Such classes can often be substitued
with a builtin python type as documented in the class.

== Attribute sequences ==

When the OWS UML or schema declares a sequence of objects it may be
modelled as a single attribute by pluralising the attribute name.
E.g. ows.data_identification.Identification.outputFormats.  In such
cases a python sequence or iterable of the specified object is
desired.
Note: ows.data_identification.Identification.metadata is pleural :-).

In some cases it is more natural to use dictionaries than sequences of
objects with name attributes.  In this case an attribute will be appended
with the word "Dict", e.g. ows.operations_metadata.OperationMetadata.operationDict.
