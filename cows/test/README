Package Organisation
====================

COWS is divided into the following package hierarchy:

 - cows: top-level package
 - model: Classes reflecting the OWS common data model
 - pylons: Components designed to work within the pylons web framework
 - service: Components implementing OGC services and backends.  Note code in this package shouldn't reference pylons.
 - test: The COWS test harness (see below)
 - xml: Parsing capabilities xml into cows.model classes

Testing COWS
============

Tests that do not require Pylons can be placed in this directory to be
discovered by nose.  

Those tests that need Pylons should be created in the testapp
directory.  testapp is a Pylons application specifically to wrap
tests.  When you run "nosetests cows" it will create the testapp
application and run the tests in the testapp/tests directory.
