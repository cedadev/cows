Doctests to test main http operations of WXS servers.

Note: These doctests require the OWSLib library to run and currently require a pylons service up and running on localhost:5000 
Also a particular configuration is needed!
#TODO: needs to integrate with testapp testing framework to remove these dependencies

Tests can be run using runalldoctests script.
